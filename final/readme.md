I mostly stuck to using css coding that was learned in class. I tried implementing the bootstrap dropdown feature but it ended up just messing up my webpage so I got rid of it. Another struggle was that floating the nav reversed there order. 

I used W3schools as well as

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rouge+Script?query=Rouge+Script&sidebar.open&selection.family=Rouge+Script

for fonts the fonts. 

bootstrap was included but not used. 

All images and art used are my own.
